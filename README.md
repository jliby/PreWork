Submitted by: James Luberisse

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [yes] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [yes] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [yes] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [ ] App could have a lot more functionality, but at the moment I do not have the expertise and knowledge to implement them.
- [ ] Here is a list:
- [ ] Different Currencies
- [ ] Slide Bar for tip percentage
- [ ] Split tip functionality

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Understanding the SwiftUI libray was a bit of a challenge. I was not able to style the app freely since my knowledge was limited. Understanding how the classes for each screen were connected was also difficult.
